"""Timer classification utilities for SWIFT log analysis.

This module provides functions to classify timers in SWIFT logs into function
and operation timers. The classification is based on execution time analysis
rather than synthetic timer generation.

Key functions:
- classify_timers_by_max_time: Main classification logic using max time per
  function

    """Classify timers using max time per function.

    For each function, the timer with the most total time is treated as the
    function timer. All others are operation timers. No synthetic timers.

    This approach eliminates the need for complex synthetic timer generation
    and instead uses the actual timing data from the SWIFT logs to determine
    which timer represents the overall function execution.

    Args:
        instances_by_step: Dictionary mapping step numbers to timer instances
        timer_db: Dictionary of timer definitions by timer ID
        nesting_db: Dictionary of nesting relationships by function name

    Returns:
        Set of timer IDs that are function timers

    Example:
        >>> function_timer_ids = classify_timers_by_max_time(
